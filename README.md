# Transformation and Shading
This was a program for my computer graphics course ( CGRA251 ) In this assignment I covered how 3D objects are transformed by rotationg and moving the objects
around the local space. This project is a expansion of my previous project [3D-File-Renderer](https://github.com/Benjamin-Fever/3D-File-Renderer).
This take on the project adds shading the the defined object and transforming a object. In this I used the Phong Shading model. This taught me a lot on how
shading is done in openGL using the .glsl file formats to program shadders into this. I also learnt a lot on how objects are rotated and moved around.
