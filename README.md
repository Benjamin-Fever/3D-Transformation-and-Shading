<h1>Transformation and Shading</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This program was from my second year computer graphics CGRA251. In this particular assignment we built of the previous assignment which can be found here -> <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Fever/3D-File-Renderer">[3D-File-Renderer]</a>. Our goal was to add transformation to our 3D generated objects. This was done by adding distance, yaw and pitch to the object. This allows us to rotate and zoom in on the 3D object. The second part of the task was to add shading. This was done with the Phong shading model.

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
How objects are rotated and moved around in a 3D space and what calulations do so. I also learnt about the phong shading model and the steps required to get basic lighting and the effect of a lit and shaded 3D model. As we are using OpenGl for this I used GLSL to do the shading.

<h2>Showcase</h2>
